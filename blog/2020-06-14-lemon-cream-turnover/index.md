This morning I baked lemon cream turnovers with some streaky bacon for brekkie.

The inverse puff pastry turned out excellent this time. It was much easier each time I went to do a turn.

I made the lemon pastry cream the night before. I decided to do this to give it longer to chill so that it would set better than when I did the éclairs. Unfortunately I had the opposite problem and it over set.
